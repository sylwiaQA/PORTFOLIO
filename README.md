## About Me
# Introduction

Hey there! I'm **Sylwia**, and I want to take you on a **unique journey** through my **unconventional entry** into the world of **technology**.

Imagine this: a passionate individual with a background as a **Clinical Trial Administrator** and a **master's degree** in **pharmacy**, now **diving headfirst** into the world of **software testing**. Sounds interesting, right? Well, that's exactly the **adventure** I'm on!

As someone who previously excelled in a **non-technical role**, I've taken on the challenge of fully **immersing** myself in the world of **technology**. You could say I'm not your **typical tech enthusiast**. From managing **clinical trials** to exploring the intricacies of **software testing**, I've embraced every new **adventure** with **open arms**.

But why the change? Well, I've always been drawn to **challenges** that push me **out of my comfort zone**. And what could be more **exciting** than diving into the **ever-evolving world** of **IT**?

With each new **concept** I grasp and every **skill** I acquire, I'm driven by a **relentless curiosity** and a desire to **excel**. And let me tell you, the transition hasn't been without its **challenges**, but it's those **obstacles** that keep me **motivated** and **hungry for more**.

So, **buckle up**, because you're about to **witness** how someone with **little to no tech background** is making **waves** in the **tech world**. Trust me, it's going to be quite the **adventure**!
